<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>(This is problem 2 from the Density Dependent Growth Worksheet.) Consider the difference equation, <span class="math inline">\(x_{t+1}=rx_t(1-x_t)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(r&gt;0.\)</span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Show that the conditions for survival in this case are <span class="math inline">\(0&lt;r&lt;4\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(0&lt;x_0\leq 1\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Under these assumptions, show that there are two fixed points, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}=\frac{r-1}{r}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Show that the non-trivial steady-state is locally asymptotically stable only if <span class="math inline">\(1&lt;r&lt;3\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Find a range of values for <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> for which there is a stable two-cycle.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose some <span class="math inline">\(2.57&lt;r&lt;3\)</span> and show how the population trajectories are sensitive to initial conditions. This is the hallmark of deterministic chaos. The most straightforward way to illustrate this is with graphs. You may use Desmos or R.</p></li>

<li><p>Consider the difference equation, <span class="math inline">\(x_{t+1}=x_t\ln x_t^2,\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(x_t\neq 0\)</span>. Find the fixed points and analyze their stability.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider the difference equation, <span class="math inline">\(x_{t+1}=x_te^{r(1-x_t/K)}.\)</span> Find the fixed points and analyze their stability. Use cobwebbing to illustrate the results for a few different values of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> (I think there are at least four cases).</p></li>
