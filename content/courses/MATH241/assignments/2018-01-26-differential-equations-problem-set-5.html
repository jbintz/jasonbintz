<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Solve the nonlinear equation.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[x&#39;=(t+x)^2\]</span></p>
<p>Hint: Transform it into a separable equation by making the substitution <span class="math inline">\(y=t+x\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Solve the second-order equation.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[x&#39;&#39;+x&#39;=3t\]</span></p>
<p>Hint: Transform it into a first-order linear equation by making the substitution <span class="math inline">\(y=x&#39;\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider the first-order linear ODE,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[x&#39;+p(t)x=q(t)\]</span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Let <span class="math inline">\(x_1(t)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_2(t)\)</span> be solutions. Show that <span class="math inline">\(x_1(t) + x_2(t)\)</span> is a solution if and only if <span class="math inline">\(q(t)\equiv 0\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Now suppose that <span class="math inline">\(x_1(t)\)</span> is a solution and <span class="math inline">\(x_2(t)\)</span> is a solution to the homogeneous problem <span class="math inline">\(x&#39;+p(t)x=0\)</span>. Show that <span class="math inline">\(x_1(t) + x_2(t)\)</span> is a solution.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Initially a tank has 60 gallons of water. A brine solution with 1 pound of salt per gallon enters the (continuously stirred and well mixed) tank at a rate of 2 gallons per minute. Solution leaves the tank at a rate of 3 gallons per minute. Find an equation that gives the amount of salt in the tank at time t for all times beginning at the initial time up until the tank is empty.</p></li>
<li><p>A differential equation of the form</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[x&#39;=a(t)x+g(t)x^n\]</span></p>
<p>is called a <strong>Bernoulli equation</strong>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Show that a Bernoulli equation can be transformed into a linear equation by making the substitution <span class="math inline">\(y=x^{1-n}\)</span> and then find a formula for the solution.</p></li>
<li><p>Solve: <span class="math inline">\(x&#39;=\frac{2}{3t}x+\frac{2t}{x}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Solve: <span class="math inline">\(t^2x&#39;+2tx-x^3=0\)</span></p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The following are two different generalizations of the logistic differential equation. Do you see why? In each case, solve the equations. Hint: they are Bernoulli equations.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(N&#39;=r(t)N\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right)\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(N&#39;=rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K(t)}\right)\)</span></p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>(Bonus) The left hand side of the differential equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[M(t,x)+N(t,x)x&#39;=0\]</span></p>
<p>looks like it might be a total derivative. It is a total derivative if there exists a function <span class="math inline">\(\psi (t,x)\)</span> such that,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{d}{dt}\psi (t,x)=M(t,x)+N(t,x)x&#39;.\]</span></p>
<p>If we can find such a function, then the differential equation above is called an <strong>exact equation</strong> and we would have that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{d}{dt}\psi (t,x)=0,\]</span></p>
<p>which implies that the solution to the equation is given implicitly by <span class="math inline">\(\psi (t,x)=C\)</span>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Show that <span class="math inline">\(M(t,x)+N(t,x)x&#39;=0\)</span> is exact if and only if <span class="math inline">\(M_x\)</span> = <span class="math inline">\(N_t\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Solve: <span class="math inline">\(t^3+\frac{x}{t}+(x^2+\ln t)x&#39;=0\)</span></p></li>
</ol></li>
