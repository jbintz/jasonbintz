1.  Show that if $x_1(t)$ and $x_2(t)$ are solutions of $x''+p(t)x'+q(t)x=0$, then so is $x(t)=c_1x_1 + c_2x_2$.

1.  Find two constants $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ such that $e^{\lambda_1t}$ and $e^{\lambda_2t}$ are each solutions of $x''+3x'+2x=0$. Then verify that $c_1e^{\lambda_1t}+c_2e^{\lambda_2t}$ is also a solution.

1.  Show that if $x_1(t)$ and $x_2(t)$ are solutions of $x''+p(t)x'+q(t)x=0$, and there exists $t_0$ such that $W(x_1, x_2)(t_0)\neq0$, then $W(x_1, x_2)(t)\neq0$ for all $t$.
