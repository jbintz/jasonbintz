1.  Problems 5.3.2, 5.3.4 on page 202.

1.  In the last part of problem 5.3.4, you produced a phase plane by hand and then used pplane for comparison. It looks like the equilibrium is a center and that the trajectories are closed periodic orbits. 

    a.  But Hartman-Grobman is inconclusive in this case. Why?
    a.  Prove that the trajectories are, in fact, closed periodic orbits. 
    
1.  Consider the following system:

    \[
      \begin{align*}
        N' &= 0.4N(1-N)-0.2NP_1-0.2NP_2 \\
        P_1' &= 0.5NP_1-0.2P_1 \\
        P_2' &= 0.4NP_2-0.05P_1P_2-0.1P_2
      \end{align*}
    \]
    
    a.  Find all the equilibria, $(\bar{N},\bar{P_1},\bar{P_2})$.
    a.  In terms of predators and prey, what do these equations model?
    a.  Is there any (long-term) scenario where the three species can coexist? Explain.
