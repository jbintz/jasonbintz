<p>Why does the budworm exhibit sudded outbreaks from low to high density and then collapse back down to low density? We investigate the budworm dynamics in this activity.</p>
<p>Consider the state equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[N&#39;=rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right)-\frac{BN^2}{A^2+N^2}\]</span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Explain the terms. What could they reasonably model?</p></li>
<li><p>Nondimensionalize this equation. First let <span class="math inline">\(x=\frac{N}{A}\)</span>, substitute, and simplify. Then make the substitution <span class="math inline">\(\tau = \frac{t}{A/B}\)</span>. Finally, let <span class="math inline">\(k=\frac{K}{A}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\rho=\frac{rA}{B}\)</span> to obtain the nondimensionalized equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[x&#39;=\rho x \left(1-\frac{x}{k}\right)-\frac{x^2}{1+x^2}\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>The nonzero equilibria are solutions of</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\rho\left(1-\frac{\bar x}{k}\right)=\frac{\bar x}{1+\bar{x}^2}.\]</span></p>
<p>This equation can have one, two, or three solutions. Draw a picture illustrates this. Then draw a phase line for each of the five possible scenarios.</p></li>
<li><p>In addition to the condition above, when there are two solutions, <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> satisfy another condition. What is it? Use these conditions to find expressions in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> for both <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. That is, find <span class="math inline">\(\rho = \rho (x)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k=k(x)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Plot <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> vs. <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> and label the resulting regions as “refuge”, “bistable”, or “outbreak”.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that increasing foliage effectively increases <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>. Describe how the dynamics of this equation can describe the situation of a budworm outbreak.</p></li>
