Why does the budworm exhibit sudded outbreaks from low to high density and then collapse back down to low density? We investigate the budworm dynamics in this activity.

Consider the state equation:

\[N'=rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right)-\frac{BN^2}{A^2+N^2}\]

1.  Explain the terms. What could they reasonably model?

1.  We will non-dimensionalize this equation. First let $x=\frac{N}{A}$, substitute, and simplify. Then make the substitution $\tau = \frac{t}{A/B}$. Finally, let $k=\frac{K}{A}$ and $\rho=\frac{rA}{B}$.

1.  Find equilibria and determine stability.

1.  To be continued!
