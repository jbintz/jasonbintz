Why does the budworm exhibit sudded outbreaks from low to high density and then collapse back down to low density? We investigate the budworm dynamics in this activity.

Consider the state equation:

\[N'=rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right)-\frac{BN^2}{A^2+N^2}\]

1.  Explain the terms. What could they reasonably model?

1.  Nondimensionalize this equation. First let $x=\frac{N}{A}$, substitute, and simplify. Then make the substitution $\tau = \frac{t}{A/B}$. Finally, let $k=\frac{K}{A}$ and $\rho=\frac{rA}{B}$ to obtain the nondimensionalized equation:

    \[x'=\rho x \left(1-\frac{x}{k}\right)-\frac{x^2}{1+x^2}\]

1.  The nonzero equilibria are solutions of

    \[\rho\left(1-\frac{\bar x}{k}\right)=\frac{\bar x}{1+\bar{x}^2}.\]
    
    This equation can have one, two, or three solutions. Draw a picture illustrates this. Then draw a phase line for each of the five possible scenarios.
    
1.  In addition to the condition above, when there are two solutions, $\rho$ and $k$ satisfy another condition. What is it? Use these conditions to find expressions in $x$ for both $\rho$ and $k$. That is, find $\rho = \rho (x)$ and $k=k(x)$.

1.  Plot $\rho$ vs. $k$ and label the resulting regions as "refuge", "bistable", or "outbreak".

1.  Suppose that increasing foliage effectively increases $\rho$. Describe how the dynamics of this equation can describe the situation of a budworm outbreak.
