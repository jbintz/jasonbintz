1.  Install R and RStudio on your computer. To do this, work through this brief [setup tutorial](https://jjallaire.shinyapps.io/learnr-tutorial-00-setup/). Even if you've already used R and/or RStudio in the past, you should make sure you have the latest installment/version of each.

2.  Complete the "Introduction to R" course at DataCamp. If you've already done this in the past, then your account at DataCamp should reflect this. If for some reason it doesn't, then you can show me that you've done it.
