We did the first two problems during our class time. Just copy/paste as appropriate.

1.  Implement the bisection method. Use the stopping criterion: `(abs(b_n - a_n) / min(abs(a_n), abs(b_n))) <= tol`. Show that this criterion guarantees the relative error is <= tol. Show that this method requires (something close to) 30 iterations for tol = 1e-10 for $f(x)=x^3+4x^2-10$ on the interval $[1,2]$.

1.  Implement Newton-Raphson. Show that this method requires 4 iterations for tol = 1e-10 for $f(x)=x^3+4x^2-10$ on the interval $[1,2]$.

1.  Exercise 10.6.6. Don't forget about the part of this problem on page 198!
