<div id="calc" class="section level2">
<h2>Calculator</h2>
<p>We will make extensive use of <a href="https://www.desmos.com">Desmos</a>, an online graphing calculator. You will also need a TI-83 or TI-84 graphing calculator since Desmos will not be available to you for quizzes and tests. There may be quizzes and/or tests where the use of a calculator will not be permitted.</p>

<div id="exams" class="section level2">
<h2>Exams</h2>
<p>There will be three in-class exams during the semester. Make up exams will only be given in extenuating circumstances; prior arrangements must be made if at all possible. Do not make travel plans that require you to miss a scheduled exam. The college final exam schedule can be found <a href="http://www.houghton.edu/registrar/final-exam-schedules/">here</a>.</p>

<div id="homework" class="section level2">
<h2>Homework</h2>
<p>You will have two types of homework assignments:</p>
<p><strong>Problem Sets</strong>: There will be approximately 10 problem sets assigned throughout the semester. These will be posted on the course website. You are encouraged to talk to other students and the professor about the problems, but you must write your own solutions and acknowledge your collaborators at the top of your work. Solutions must be clear and neat. Do not make the mistake of thinking that understanding someone else’s solution means that you are able to do the problem yourself! Finding solutions on the internet and/or copying from another student’s work is strictly prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>WebAssign</strong>: After (almost) every class, you will have a WebAssign assignment that must be completed before the next class period.</p>

<div id="guidelines" class="section level2">
<h2>Homework Guidelines</h2>
<p>Homework must be neat–if your homework is illegible, it will not be graded! You must submit a physical copy of your homework–emailed homework will not be accepted! Homework is due at the beginning of class. Late homework will not be accepted. Solutions to homework questions must be clear and your process must be explained. Complete sentences should be used where appropriate.</p>

<div id="grading" class="section level2">
<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>Problem sets will be worth around 30% of your grade, WebAssign assignments 20%, exams 30%, and the final exam 20%. I reserve the right to change the grading distribution. Final letter grades will be assigned based on the scale below at a minimum (i.e., if you earn a 94% overall in the course, your final grade will be at least an A-):</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>
<p>Some possible places to find assistance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fellow students</li>
<li>Help sessions</li>
<li>Office hours</li>
<li>The internet; there are several good websites with calculus help that you are welcome to use for additional explanations, but you may not use the internet for solutions</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div id="time" class="section level2">
<h2>Time Commitment</h2>
<p>In accordance with the guidelines of 2–3 hours of work for each credit hour for a course, the well-prepared student should spend approximately 8–12 hours of work per week beyond the time spent in class. If you find that you are spending significantly more time than this, please let me know so that I can help you be more efficient or adjust the workload. If you are spending less time than this, you may not be investing enough time to learn well.</p>
