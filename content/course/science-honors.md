## Course Resources {#resources}

-  [R, RStudio, and all that...](/resources/Rstuff/)
-  DataCamp: I have set up a [DataCamp group](https://www.datacamp.com/groups/science-honors) for Science Honors. You should have received an email invitation to join. Some important details:
    -  **Pay no attention to the due dates listed on DataCamp!** They have been a bit buggy in the past, so I made the assignment "due dates" rather arbitrary. The real due dates will be posted on the course website.
    -  as a member of this group you have access to **all** of DataCamp's premium content, not just the assigned material
-  woRkshop ggplot-intro raw .Rmd file is [here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jbintz/94e7bcdbc5655dc293151c73a1b5a505/raw/13e19d3f983fd69ea85a646fceb0f6ddaf3d41fb/ggplot-intro.Rmd)
