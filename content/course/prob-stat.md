## Course Resources {#resources}

-  [Syllabus](/courses/MATH333/syllabus/)
-  [R, RStudio, and all that...](/resources/allthingsR/)
-  DataCamp: I have set up a [DataCamp group](https://www.datacamp.com/groups/science-honors) for this course. You should have received an email invitation to join. Some important details:
    -  **Pay no attention to the due dates listed on DataCamp!** They have been a bit buggy in the past, so I made the assignment "due dates" rather arbitrary. The real due dates will be posted on the course website.
    -  as a member of this group you have access to **all** of DataCamp's premium content, not just the assigned material

## Assignments {#assn}

### Assignment 1: Due Wednesday, August 30

1.  Install R and RStudio on your computer. To do this, work through this brief [setup tutorial](https://jjallaire.shinyapps.io/learnr-tutorial-00-setup/). Even if you've already used R and/or RStudio in the past, you should make sure you have the latest installment/version of each.

2.  Complete the "Introduction to R" course at DataCamp. If you've already done this in the past, then your account at DataCamp should reflect this. If for some reason it doesn't, then you can show me that you've done it.

### Assignment 2: Due Friday, September 1


### Assignment 3: Due Wednesday, September 6

1. Complete the "Explorartory Data Analysis" course at DataCamp.
