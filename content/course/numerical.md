DataCamp: I have set up a [DataCamp group](https://www.datacamp.com/groups/numerical-analysis) for this course. You should have received an email invitation to join. Some important details:

-  **Pay no attention to the due dates listed on DataCamp!** They have been a bit buggy in the past, so I made the assignment "due dates" rather arbitrary. The real due dates will be posted on the course website.

-  as a member of this group you have access to **all** of DataCamp's premium content, not just the assigned material
