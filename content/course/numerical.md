## Course Resources {#resources}

#### Syllabus 

Here is the [syllabus](/courses/MATH395/syllabus/).

#### R, RStudio, and all that...

This has its own [page](/resources/allthingsR/).

#### DataCamp 

I have set up a [DataCamp group](https://www.datacamp.com/groups/numerical-analysis) for this course. You should have received an email invitation to join. Some important details:

-  **Pay no attention to the due dates listed on DataCamp!** They have been a bit buggy in the past, so I made the assignment "due dates" rather arbitrary. The real due dates will be posted on the course website.

-  as a member of this group you have access to **all** of DataCamp's premium content, not just the assigned material

#### GitHub 

You'll need to register an account with GitHub. Some good advice and instructions can be found [here](http://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html).
