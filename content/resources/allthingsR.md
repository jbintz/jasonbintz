### Setup

The very first thing you should do is install R and RStudio on your computer. To do this, work through this brief [setup tutorial](https://jjallaire.shinyapps.io/learnr-tutorial-00-setup/).

### DataCamp

The next thing is to begin learning R; that is, to become a useR! DataCamp offers interactive R and Python courses on topics in data science, statistics, and machine learning. You don't need R or RStudio on your computer to take these courses--they provide an interactive R enviroment that is fully integrated into the tutorials.

DataCamp's [Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) course is completely free, and you should start your jouRney there. If you are in one of my classes that has its own DataCamp *group*, then this course will be the first assignment. So make sure to join the group!

### R for Data Science

Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham's excellent book, [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz), is a great resource for "mastering" the `tidyverse`.
